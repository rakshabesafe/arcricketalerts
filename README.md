# Ultralite SDK Sample for Android
This software is a sample application built using the [Ultralite SDK for Android](https://github.com/Vuzix/ultralite-sdk-android). It shows how to implement features for the Vuzix Z100™ smart glasses, with a primary example focused on delivering live cricket scores and alerts.

The cricket alert functionality specifically demonstrates fetching data from external sources (like ESPNCricinfo's RSS feeds and web pages) and presenting this information in a timely manner on the glasses display.

This is intended to allow developers to quickly become familiar with the capabilities of the Ultralite SDK, and learn how to easily add support for the Vuzix Z100™ smart glasses in their own applications.
